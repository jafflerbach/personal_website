I'm excited to be part of a new research group - the [Conservation Aquaculture Research Team](http://www.cart-sci.org/) at NCEAS. Our group is interested in helping shape the future of **sustainable aquaculture**. Over the past couple of decades, farmed seafood has grown significantly and is likely to become the dominant source of where we get our fish as global populations increase. I wanted to take a look at this trend over time using data from the [Food and Agriculture Organization](http://www.fao.org/home/en/) (FAO). This also gave me the opportunity to play with some of the packages out there that create dynamic visualizations. I've used the [`plotly`](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/getting-started/) and [`googlevis`](https://github.com/mages/googleVis#googlevis) R packages to create interactive plots, and the [`animation`](https://yihui.name/animation/) package to create gifs from raster data (e.g. Sea Surface Temperature over time), but I've never created a high-quality dynamic visualization. I know [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is often used to create beautiful figures, but I don't have the time to learn D3.js (yet) and I figured there *had* to be a way to do something fancy in R. And of course, I was right. So this is my process of creating a dynamic visualization with the [`tweenr`](https://github.com/thomasp85/tweenr) package.

## Installation

Install and/or load packages:

I use `ggplot2`, `gganimate`, `ggthemes` anad `tweenr` for customizing the figures.

```{r, eval = F}
library(ggplot2)
#devtools::install_github("dgrtwo/gganimate")
library(gganimate)
library(tweenr)
library(ggthemes)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data wrangling

I start with data downloaded from [FAO’s website](http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-production/en), specifically the “Total Production” dataset CSV. One problem with using this dataset to understand how seafood production from wild capture (i.e. wild-caught from the ocean) and aquaculture (farmed, not wild) has grown over time, is that this data does not differentiate between fish caught for consumption versus non-consumption (e.g. fish used for feed).

```{r, eval = F}
#this data identifies aquaculture vs wild capture production  
source <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CART-sci/storymap/master/data/GlobalProuction_2017.1.1/CL_FI_PRODUCTION_SOURCE.csv")
    
#this is the time series data for global production (does not discern b/w seafood and nonseafood)  
fao <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CART-sci/storymap/master/data/GlobalProuction_2017.1.1/TS_FI_PRODUCTION.csv")
    
##species info  
spp <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CART-sci/storymap/master/data/GlobalProuction_2017.1.1/CL_FI_SPECIES_GROUPS.csv") %>%
  mutate(Species = `3Alpha_Code`) 
```

By using a second dataset on global food supply of seafood, I can calculate the amount of fish caught for consumption. Why not only use this dataset? Because this one does not differentiate between wild capture and aquaculture.

If you’re interested in the data I used, here is a screenshot of the manual query on FAOSTAT.

I am still hopeful that someone, somewhere will create an FAO R package that lets me query all of their data directly from R. In the meantime, I'll wrangle these two datasets together as best I can.

```{r, eval = F}
#read in the seafood data queried from FAOSTAT and get totals per year  
seafood <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CART-sci/storymap/master/data/FAOSTAT_data_12-21-2017.csv") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(sf_tons = sum(Value))
```

### Calculate annual capture and aquaculture production

Since no dataset from FAO has exactly what I want, I can take the seafood dataset, calculate total production (tons) per year, and then remove the total aquaculture production for each year calculated from the `fao` dataset. Then I have wild capture seafood per year (from the `seafood` dataset), and aquaculture production per year (from the `fao` dataset).

```{r, eval = F}
data <- fao %>%
  left_join(spp) %>%
  mutate(source = 
           case_when(
             Source %in% c(1,2,3,5) ~ "Aquaculture",
             Source == 4 ~ "Wild_Capture"
           )) %>%
  filter(Major_Group != "PLANTAE AQUATICAE") %>% #removing aquatic plants  
  mutate(source = as.factor(source)) %>%         #doing this for tweenr...still don't know why we need to  
  group_by(source, Year) %>%
  summarize(tons = sum(Quantity, na.rm = T)/1000000) %>%
  filter(Year > 1989) %>%                        #only interested in showing 1990 onwards  
  spread(source, tons) %>%
  left_join(seafood, by = "Year") %>%
  mutate(Wild_for_food = (sf_tons/1000000) - Aquaculture) %>% #subtract aquaculture from seafood series to get wild capture for seafood  
  filter(!is.na(Wild_for_food)) %>%
  select(Year, Aquaculture, Wild_for_food)
```

### Forecast production values

The data only goes to 2013, but I want to include forecasted growth of these two sectors. The 2016 [State of the Worlds Fisheries and Aquaculture report](http://www.fao.org/publications/sofia/2016/en/) projects a 39% growth in Aquaculture production and just a 1% growth in Wild Capture. To make this easy, I simply used the 2013 production values and set the 2025 values to 139% and 101% of those values.

I create two new dataframes, one for all years 2014-2024 with two years full of `NA`, one for Aquaculture and one for `Wild_for_food` (Wild Capture). The second is a one row dataframe for the year 2025 with the `Aquaculture` and `Wild_fod_food` values equal to 139% and 101% of their 2013 values respectively. Using the `zoo::na.approx()` function I simply do a linear interpolation of production values between 2013 and 2025.

```{r, eval = F}
#forecast forward to 2025
#Projected 1% of growth in wild capture by 2025
#projected 39% for aquaculture
    
yrs <- data.frame(Year = 2014:2024,
                  Aquaculture = NA,
                  Wild_for_food = NA)
    
data_2025 <- data.frame(Year = 2025,
                        Aquaculture = 1.39*last(data$Aquaculture),
                        Wild_for_food = 1.01*last(data$Wild_for_food))
    
plot_data <- data %>%
  rbind(yrs, data_2025) %>%
  mutate(Aquaculture = zoo::na.approx(.$Aquaculture),
         Wild_for_food = zoo::na.approx(.$Wild_for_food)) %>%
  gather(source, tons, Aquaculture, Wild_for_food)%>%
  mutate(ease = "linear",
         x = Year) %>%
  rename(y = tons,
         id = source,
         time = Year)
```

Notice I renamed the columns to `x`, `y`, `id`, and `time`. This is for use in the next section with `tweenr`. The `x` column identifies what I want on the x-axis (years), `y` identifies the y-axis (tons), `id` identifies the different series for plotting (Aquaculture or Wild_for_food) and `time` is used to tell `tween_elements()` what the different time points will be for interpolation. The `ease` column will tell `tween_elements()` what the easing (or interpolation) function will be. In this case, I just want a linear interpolation between my datapoints.

## Making the plot

Here's how I went from creating a static `ggplot` to animating with `gganimate` then improving it with `tweenr`

### Static ggplot

```{r, eval = F}
static_plot <- ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = time, y = y)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = id), show.legend = F) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Seafood Production (million tonnes)") +
  theme_minimal()
    
static_plot
```

### Animate with `gganimate()`

You can animate a static ggplot just with the [`gganimate()` package](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate).

```{r, eval = F}
dynam_plot <- ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = x, y = y, cumulative = TRUE, frame = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = id), show.legend = F) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Seafood Production (million tonnes)") +
  theme_hc() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 25)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#24757A", "#7FBAC0")) +
  ylim(0, 100) +
  theme_hc() 
      
gganimate(dynam_plot, filename = "fao_gganimate.gif", title_frame = F)

```

### Smooth animation with `tweenr` + `ggplot` + `gganimate`

To make the animation smoother, I’m using the tweenr package. Specifically, the `tween_elements()` function creates a new dataframe with interpolated points between your datapoints (called "tweens" !) allowing `gganimate` to plot all these points one after the other, resulting in a smooth dynamic visualization. The `nframes` argument allows you to set how many total timepoints you want. I played around with this and chose 100 because I thought it gave the right speed. The more `nframes`, the more points to plot and thus the slower the visualization. I suggest just playing with this argument until the animation looks right to you. 

After creating the new dataframe with `tween_elements()` you use `ggplot` and `gganimate` to create the final animation.

```{r, eval=F}
data_tween <- plot_data %>%
  tween_elements(., "time", "id", "ease", nframes = 100) %>%   #using tweenr!
  mutate(year = round(time), id = .group) %>%
  left_join(plot_data)
    
tween_plot <- ggplot(data_tween, aes(x = x, y = y, frame = .frame, color = id)) +
  geom_path(aes(group = id, cumulative = T), size = 1, show.legend = F) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Seafood Production (million tonnes)") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 25)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#24757A", "#7FBAC0")) +
  ylim(0, 100) +
  theme_hc() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y = element_text( size=12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12)) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1994, y = 29, label = "Aquaculture", 
           cex = 6, angle = 22, fontface = "bold", color = "#24757A") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1994, y = 70, label = "Wild Capture", 
           cex = 6, fontface = "bold", color = "#7FBAC0") +
  geom_segment(aes(x=2015,xend=2020, y=88, yend=88),arrow=arrow(length=unit(0.2,"cm")),show.legend=F, color = "darkgray") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 2013, y = 88, label = "Estimated \nfuture growth", color= "darkgray", fontface = "bold", cex = 4.5, angle = 90) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(2015), linetype="dotted"); tween_plot
    
gganimate(tween_plot, title_frame = FALSE, interval = 0.05)
```

I spent a lot of time messing with the text sizes, colors, label placement, etc. I also learned how to add an arrow (thanks, `geom_segment()`). While I could keep tweaking this forever, I think it's good enough as is. The whole process of learning how to use `tweenr` took me just a couple hours and I'm excited for the next opportunity to make something like this!
