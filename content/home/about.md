# About Me

I am a marine data scientist with the [Ocean Health Index](http://ohi-science.org/) at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara, California where I am the lead analyst for the [US Northeast Ocean Health Index assessment](http://ohi-northeast.weebly.com/) and one of many scientists working on the annual global OHI assessments. My work includes assessing the global status of fisheries using data limited methods and synthesizing large spatial datasets to estimate and track human impacts on the global oceans. Recently I've also been studying the future of mariculture with the [Conservation Aquaculture Research Team](http://www.cart-sci.org/team.html). 

I am also an enthusiastic proponent of open science and try to implement open science practices in my work. In 2017 our research group published [a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) detailing our path to better science in less time using tools such as GitHub, R and RStudio.
I also lead and support data science training efforts for environmental scientists. It's becoming clear that modern environmental problems will demand data-driven solutions, but there is a [significant gap](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/biosci/bix025#80702600) in training environmental scientists how to work with data effectively. I have been a Software Carpentry helper and instructor in 4 workshops and coordinate an environmental data science study group at UCSB called [EcoDataScience](http://eco-data-science.github.io/). I am also a co-founder of the [Santa Barbara R-Ladies meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/).

I live in Santa Barbara with my husband and my dog, Banjo. In my freetime I enjoy hiking in the Santa Barbara foothills, cooking, playing beach volleyball and drinking wine.
