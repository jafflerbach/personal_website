# About Me

I am currently the program coordinator for the [Master's of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) (MEDS) degree program at UC Santa Barbara. Previously, I worked as a marine data scientist at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS).

I also lead and support data science training efforts for environmental scientists. In 2015 I co-founded [EcoDataScience](http://eco-data-science.github.io/), an environmental data science study group at UCSB. I am also a co-founder of the [Santa Barbara R-Ladies meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/).
